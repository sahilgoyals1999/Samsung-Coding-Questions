There is a n x n matrix with only 0s & 1s. Letters are formed using 1 and 0. For eg.-

            U is 1 0 1,  V is 1 0 1
                 1 0 1        1 0 1
                 1 1 1        0 1 0
Likewise there are 6 letters and they can rotated in 90, 180, 270, 360 degree. And if there is a letter, the next column would be filled with 0. Eg.

             V- 1 0 1 0
                1 0 1 0
                0 1 0 0
So we have to count the number of each letter in the matrix.
